Earthen - Smiths built atop [moon](https://github.com/archSeer/moon)

## How to spin up ES moon
First up you'll need a copy of [moon](https://github.com/polyfox/moon), follow
the installation and building instructions there and then return here.

Running the game is done via the helper script `play`, else run `moon-mruby ./main.rb`.

ES uses its own version of the bootstrap, so DO NOT RUN `moon-player`.

If your name is archSeer or IceDragon, then this should work correctly.

### Optional [in case all else fails]

In case that the above didn't work, you may need some graphical resources that weren't included due to licensing.

In that case, I can't help you, sorry.
