School
======

Oh hi, what brings you to my notes?

Whatever it may be, welcome to the es-moon notes, this is just an extract
from IceDragon's ever messy EDOS notes.

## What is the School?

I actually have no idea, its somewhere between the world of Earthen, and
the spirit world.


## That was "where", not what!

Oh right, the school is a Combat and Magic boarding school, or
CaM for short.

Students are taught how to use magic and to fight with weapons and
periodically bare handed / melee combat.
Only a few are allowed to enter the school.

Students board for approx 5 years, they may not leave before completing the
5 years, summer breaks are done at school.

Communication with the outside is restricted to special time frames,
and only letters may be sent to and from.


## So what's it like?

On the outside, CaM appears to be a normal school, students in uniform,
student council, blah de dah.
On the inside its what you'd expect from a school, writing boards,
good old Wothren desk's...


## HOLD UP, Whats Wothren!?

Err, its wood taken from the great tree and guardian spirit Worenike?


## Oh, WAIT WAT?

Um, there are 6 leader guardian spirits...

- Gaiadrom (Gai-a-dr-om) of the land
- Drakraos (Dra-ke-os) of the shadow
- Valdine (Val-dine) of the liquid/water/aqua
- Inflamari (In-fla-ma-ri) of the flare
- Xenolto (Zen-ol-to) of the atmos/air
- Xenura (Zen-ooh-ra) of the light

## Six(6) Elements?

Yep, or 4 elements and 2 alignments if you want to call it that.

Fire, Water, Earth, Wind > Flare, Aqua, Land, Atmos respectively

and Light, Dark > Lumi, Shadow


## Are there anymore guardian spirits?

Yes, but. um, I think we're straying from the point here...


## Right so the school, whats the student population?

I have no idea, probably around 300 students, 5 years, 3 classes each,
approximately 20 students per class.

Sounds about right.


## How big is the school?

2 floors + basement and rooftop


## Whats accessible to the students?

2 floors and the rooftop.


## Why not the basement?

Ask the principal...


## What is the purpose of the school in the game?

Its the starting point of the game and gives a basic run through of the game's
control without putting the player under too much pressure.


## Where do we start?

Actually you start from Baron's mind plane...


## Mind plane?

Consult the upcoming mind_plane.md


## So when do we go to the school?

Exactly after the events in the mind plane, which shouldn't be too long.


## How do we get there?

Baron, the main character is already attending school and is in his final
year, not to mention the day is his graduation.

He will awaken after the mind plane event and ready himself to the graduation
ceremony.

After which the player will be free to roam around the campus until they
wish to continue the game by going to the rooftop.


## Why the rooftop?

I dunno, it was the first thing I did with the original game, a battle
with a dragon on the rooftop!


## Dragon, seriously?

Actually I might change it, just deal with it for now.


## So what happens before/afterwards?

1. During the graduation, Baron noticed someone watching from the entrance
   to the hall.
2. Intrigued, after the ceremony was over, he looked around the school for the
   individual.
3. After not finding anything on the ground levels, he sets his sight on the
   roof.
4. Since Baron had graduated, he was to return to Earthen.
5. His childhood friend Chelsea (who we will refer to as Chika from here on)
   was to pick him up
6. However, she moved a little too fast, and caused a few problems with the
   inter dimension po-po (actually I don't have a name for them)
7. Chika's childhood friend, an elf named Spyet, rushes in to warn her and
   take her back before the po-po arrive.
8. Unfortunately, a few seconds after Spyet's arrival the po-po start warping
   in 1 after the other (there was about 20 of them)


## HOLD UP, 20 PO-PO for 1 GIRL!?

Hey, leaving 1 dimension to enter another is serious business, especially
unauthorized travelling.


## Okay then, continue

9. So after a short skirmish, the group (Baron, Chika and Spyet) are knocked
   aside and into the warp gate / portal that Spyet came from.

10. Here ends the School scene.


## Okay cool, but I'd like to make a suggestion

Um, pull request, issue, comment, email me?
Anything that floats your boat.
