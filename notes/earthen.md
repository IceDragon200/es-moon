Earthen
=======

Oh hi, what brings you to my notes?

Whatever it may be, welcome to the es-moon notes, this is just an extract from IceDragon's ever messy EDOS/ES notes.


## What is Earthen?
According to Google:
```
Earthen

adjective
(of a floor or structure) made of compressed earth.
"earthen mounds"

(of a pot) made of baked or fired clay.
"on shelves sat earthen jugs"
```

## No, WHAT IS EARTHEN!?
Easy there, Earthen is the name of world in which this game's story takes place.

## Oh, so why Earthen?
Since the original focus of the game was crafting, I named it after the "earth".

## So whats it like?
Bit o magic, a bit of industrialization, blah de dah.
In short its very primitive, they still don't have electricity per say.

## Bit o Magic?
Consult magic.md

## And a bit of Industrialization
Not your crazy machines, just simple machines partly powered by magic.

## Okay cool, but I'd like to make a suggestion

Um, pull request, issue, comment, email me?
Anything that floats your boat.
