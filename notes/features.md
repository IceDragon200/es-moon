* Crafting
  Possibly the most central feature of the game is its crafting.
  The focus on making your own weapons is enforced by the game's crafting
  system.
  While its possible to buy armor and items, weapons are never available
  to the player for purchase.

* Equipment Growth
  If a weapon is crafted with a special ore, it may gain the potential to grow,
  growing weapons tend to be weaker than there static brethen at first,
  however they "grow" and become much stronger later on.

* Emblems
  Emblems can be considered individual achievements per character.
  These emblems give the character special boosts, or are sometimes just
  cosmetic.

* Character Traits
  May it be a injury from childhood, or profiency with a certain hand,
  traits will reflect it all.

* Multi-cast Magic System
  There are many ways to skin a cat, and there are many ways to accomplish the
  same magic spell.

* Roguelike Tactical Battle System
