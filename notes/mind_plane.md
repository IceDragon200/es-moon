Mind Plane
==========

Oh hi, what brings you to my notes?

Whatever it may be, welcome to the es-moon notes, this is just an extract
from IceDragon's ever messy EDOS notes.


## What is a Mind Plane?

Think of it as a visual presentation of one's state of mind.


## Err, English?

Its magic that shows a person's mind as an area.


## Still don't get it...

Think of webpage rendering, you have the data and then you have the html/css
The mind plane is the css.


## Me thinks me gets it now

Good, because I'm not saying anymore.


## So what is a Mind Plane used for?

Apart from showing a person's state of mind, it is also the santuary of the
mind, and the most comfortable place for the user/host.

A mind's plane can be used to communicate with the host privately without
external interruption, assuming that the host will allow you to enter their
plane.


## Sounds familiar

Its not a world blowing original concept.


## Is there anything else you'd like to add?

Yes, don't enter a Mind Plane while the individual is awake.

Because of the amount of mental activity that takes place while awake,
the Mind Plane is normally unstable at this point, and you may find yourself
falling into a void.


## So its best to enter while sleeping?

That is correct, when the mind is at rest, the Mind Plane is most stable.


## Cool, but why does it exist?

A mind plane allows individuals from different locations to communicate, face
to face (sorta).

With practice and a good source of energy, its possible to do it cross dimension
as well.


## Neat, its like a modern day video call, but for this world?

Correct.


## Okay cool, but I'd like to make a suggestion

Um, pull request, issue, comment, email me?
Anything that floats your boat.
