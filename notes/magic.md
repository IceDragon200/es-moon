Earthen
=======

Oh hi, what brings you to my notes?

Whatever it may be, welcome to the es-moon notes, this is just an extract
from IceDragon's ever messy EDOS/ES notes.


## Magic?
Yes, Earthen has magic, it is based on an atomic concept of Elegens.

## Wat
| Wat | Earthen | Science |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Basic Unit | Elegen | Atom |

Essentialy elegens are the basic unit of magic in Earthen.
Every living being has elegens, some lower than others.
This also means that all beings are *capable* of magic.
However there are many non-magic users in Earthen, mostly as it takes
great practice to properly control ones own elegens.

## Oh, Cool, so almost every living being has elegens?
Yes including trees, and the great tree `Worenike`, from which `Wothren` wood
is taken.

## HOLD UP, Whats Wothren!?
Err, its wood taken from the great tree and guardian spirit `Worenike`.
I just said that.

## Oh, WAIT WAT?
`sigh`, there are 6 *leader* guardian spirits...

- Gaiadrom (Gai-a-dr-om) of the land
- Drakraos (Dra-ke-os) of the shadow
- Valdine (Val-dine) of the liquid/water/aqua
- Inflamari (In-fla-ma-ri) of the flare
- Xenolto (Zen-ol-to) of the atmos/air
- Xenura (Zen-ooh-ra) of the light


## Only 6?
No, 6 *leaders*.
There are more guardian spirits almost 3x more.

## And Six(6) Elements?
Yep, or 4 elements and 2 alignments if you want to call it that.

Fire, Water, Earth, Wind : Flare, Aqua, Land, Atmos; respectively

and Light, Dark : Lumi, Shadow; which are the other 2 elements/alignments.


## Are there anymore guardian spirits?
Yes, but. um, I think we're straying from the point here...

## Ok, so is that all to magic?
Nope, there are other things such as extended, extended-impure, cross
and aligned elements.

## Thats quite a bit
Yes it is, extended and extended-impure elements are simply highly concentrated
elegens.
extended elegens are considered *pure* elegens, while extended extended-impure
are impure, they are the same in concept but impure are weaker than pure.

## Ok, so what are these extended elegens?
| Element | Extended | Extended-Impure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flare | Lava | Burn |
| Aqua | Ice | Whirlpool |
| Land | Diamond | Acid |
| Atmos | Pressure | Storm |

## Ok, so what are the cross and aligned elements now?
Cross elements are 2 elegens mixed together to form a new element.
Aligned elements are still being researched.

## And the cross elements?
| Element 1 | Element 2 | Cross Element |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Aqua | Atmos | Humidity |
| Aqua | Flare | Steam |
| Atmos | Flare | Scorch |
| Atmos | Land | Dust |
| Land | Aqua | Mud |
| Land | Flare | Magma |

## And the aligned elements
Only one is known so far:
| Element 1 | Element 2 | Cross Element |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lumi | Flare | Solar |

## Okay cool, but I'd like to make a suggestion
Um, pull request, issue, comment, email me?
Anything that floats your boat.
