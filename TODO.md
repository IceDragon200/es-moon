## That Editor!

* ~~Can select a tile~~

* ~~Can place a tile~~

* ~~Can remove a tile~~

* ~~Tile selection panel!~~

* Awesome dashboard thing ma bob

  Just a dropdown panel with save button maybe?
  Also layer buttons, and a toggle button for showing passage editor,
  vs tile editor.


* Saving

  Just dump a YAML file or something...


* Loading

  Just load aforementioned dumped YAML file or something...


* Layer selection panel!?
  If the dashboard doesn't cut it...


## Entity interaction

* ~~Entity System Draft~~

* Add other entities other than the player

  For now something like a sign, this means we'd need a message box I guess?

  * Entities are stored in a quadtree, so that we can fetch and render only
    the ones visible on screen.

  * Systems operate on filtered ranges of entities.

    Filters are usually whether entity includes or excludes a component.

  * Entities communicate with each other using a messaging system that triggers
    events (Eventable).

  * Pre-programmed sequences, like a moving pattern, etc. are defined in a behavioral tree
    and AI controllers are basically just stepping over the behavior tree.

  * Collision detection is done using a system that uses the entity quadtree,
    and only checks between collisions of objects in the same region.

  * Notifying an entity that a player is nearby ("attack me!") can be done by
    notifying the entities in the same quadtree section.

* Setup action triggers! (at least plan them)

  when a collides with b do x, y, z


* Some sort of event system? (we could create a ruby DSL for it)

## Complete the first Area

Chunk > Map > Area
Areas have many Maps, Maps have many Chunks, and Chunks are data


## Minimal Combat!

* Combat...

* Go do a zelda thing for now

* Simple shift system

  Its an old feature from Yggdrasil, by pressing a key you could quickly
  change the player entity to another party member.

* Flying stuff (projectiles)
