## That Editor!

* ~~Can select a tile~~

* ~~Can place a tile~~

* ~~Can remove a tile~~

* ~~Tile selection panel!~~

* Awesome dashboard thing ma bob

  Just a dropdown panel with save button maybe?
  Also layer buttons, and a toggle button for showing passage editor,
  vs tile editor.


* Saving

  Just dump a YAML file or something...


* Loading

  Just load aforementioned dumped YAML file or something...


* Layer selection panel!?
  If the dashboard doesn't cut it...


## Entity interaction

* Add other entities other than the player

  For now something like a sign, this means we'd need a message box I guess?


* Setup action triggers! (at least plan them)

  when a collides with b do x, y, z


* Some sort of event system? (we could create a ruby DSL for it)

## Complete the first Area

Chunk > Map > Area
Areas have many Maps, Maps have many Chunks, and Chunks are data


## Minimal Combat!

* Combat...

* Go do a zelda thing for now

* Simple shift system

  Its an old feature from Yggdrasil, by pressing a key you could quickly
  change the player entity to another party member.

* Flying stuff (projectiles)
