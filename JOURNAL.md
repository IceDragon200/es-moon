## Journal of a rambling dragon

* 2014/04/10

  Decided to start a journal, a mruby Numeric#round bug has stabbed me
  in the foot, I've quickly worked around it by just using #to_i for now.


* 2014/04/11 (later that morning/night ?)

  Float#round has been fixed upstream

  We now have IO and YAML, I don't think I'll be porting anything big yet though.

  Probably use it for save data?

  Staring at the code


* 2014/04/12 [10:34 PM]

  Threw out the old PaintMap class for the new v2 version which is much
  easier to use (big thanks to archSeer)

  Now I should work on that Map format...

  Yay! fixed my horrible markdown


* 2014/04/12 [9:25 PM]

  Programmers remorse, I just wasted the day fixing the passage stuff.

  BUT IT WAS WORTH IT!!!

  So I just realized that writing maps in code is going to get ugly fast,
  about time we start on that internal map editor I guess.

  For some odd reason, the best time to work is in the night when its nice
  and cool, however its bad for my health!

  Why am I still awake at a time like this?

  I haven't even put any code to the game!

  Aha, at least I started on some notes, that way I can figure out the
  floorplan for the school I guess?

  We are now known as "Lost in Japan", and yes we have nothing to do
  with Japan.

  TODO.md, finally...

  Yesterday was day of the Input and Vector rehaul!
  Today, is the day I finally throw the old chunk code out!?

  When was the last time I updated this journal...

  So many magical things happened since :D
